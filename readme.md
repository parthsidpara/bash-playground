# Bash Playground

https://bash-playground.vercel.app/

A simple toy project to run Bash scripts directly from the browser. Built just for fun and learning.

Uses a small Node.js backend to proxy requests to the Paiza.io API


## Future Potential Enhancements

- CodeMirror integration (multiple code cells, autocomplete, themes)
- Custom API
- Save/load code snippets
- Terminal-like UI with history and prompt
